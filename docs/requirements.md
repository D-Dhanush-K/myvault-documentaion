- Users can upload and organize personal documents securely.
- Users can write and store personal diary entries with privacy settings.
- Data encryption and authentication mechanisms will be implemented to ensure security.
- The system will be accessible via a web application with future scope for a mobile app.

# Overall Description

## 1. Product Perspective

This is a standalone web application that ensures user data is securely stored and managed. The system will be cloud-based, providing access from any device while ensuring data security and privacy.


## 2. User Needs

- Securely store personal information.
- Access uploaded documents easily.
- Write diary entries in a privacy-controlled environment.
- Ensure data is encrypted and accessible only to the user.

## 3. Assumptions and Dependencies

- Users must authenticate before accessing personal data.
- The system relies on Firebase, AWS, or a secure backend for data storage.
- The application will be responsive and support mobile devices.

# Functional Requirements
